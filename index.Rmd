title: "Modules for Infusing Data Science into the Statistics Curriculum"
---

* * * 

## Overview

This workshop will explore ways to incorporate data-scientific topics into existing statistics courses, especially at the introductory level. It will preview modules that allow for the inclusion of introductory tutorials and lab activities into courses for students with limited technical backgrounds. Participants will work through class-tested tutorials and lab activities. Key topics will include data wrangling and statistical graphics. The workshop will close with a discussion related to how these materials have been used in existing courses and an overview of the supporting materials. Basic knowledge of R will be valuable, but not required.

The tutorials and case studies were developed by [Adam Loy](https://aloy.github.io/), [Shonda Kuiper](https://www.grinnell.edu/users/kuipers), and [Laura Chihara](http://www.people.carleton.edu/~lchihara/) with support from the [ACM FaCE program](http://www.acm.edu/professional_development/FaCE__Faculty_Career_Enhancement_Project_.html) and [The Teagle Foundation](http://hybridliberalarts.org/about/). 

Special thanks for Ivan Ramler for helping with the workshop!

## Outline


### Welcome!

1. Introductions
2. Brief overview of the project

### Data visualization with `ggplot2`

##### Workflow

1. Download the zip file containing the module. (Note: Mac users will need to use Chrome or Firefox, the download does not work with Safari.)
1. Upload the zip file to the R Studio server OR unzip and store in a logical location on your laptop.
1. Plot some data with `ggplot2`!

#####  Additional resources

### Data wrangling with `dplyr`

##### Workflow

1. Download the zip file containing the module.  (Note: Mac users will need to use Chrome or Firefox, the download does not work with Safari.)
1. Upload the zip file to the R Studio server OR unzip and store in a logical location on your laptop.
1. Wrangle some data with `dplyr`!
