title: "Tutorials"
---

Below is the complete list of tutorials that were created last summer. We wrote the materials so that they would be accessible to an introductory student in a class setting or a more-advanced student outside of class. You can download all of the materials for a topic by selecting *zip* (note: Mac users need to use Chrome or Firefox for the zip file to download). You can preview the tutorials as html documents. If you're a [GitHub](https://github.com/) user, please feel free to fork the [repository](https://github.com/ds4stats/r-tutorials)!

### Labs for Intro Stats

This Fall, I adapted the visualization and data wrangling labs for use in my introductory statistics course. I also created additional labs to continue to introduce students to R. Below are the set of labs I used in class.

Here is the [full schedule](http://math107-lu.github.io/) for my class.
